\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:introduction}

In this project, our task is to study specific software development technologies and platforms. Specifically, we will:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete a FeedApp prototype implementation with free choice of technology stack
    \item Implement a new technology in our stack and perform a technology assessment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prototype implementation}

Our prototype is an implementation of a polling application. Users can create, vote on, and delete polls. The application includes a nice front-end, where potential users have to create accounts to use the application. 

\subsubsection{Implemented technology stack}

The technology stack we used was the following: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spring as the application framework
    \item React as the Web UI
    \item Redis for caching
    \item RabbitMQ for messaging
    \item JPA and H2 for persistence 
    \item Docker for containerization
    \item Github and Github Actions for the repository and CI
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

Put results from the Neo4j experiment here

\begin{itemize}

\item A one paragraph overview at the end, explaining how the rest of the report is / has been organised.

\end{itemize}

\noindent
This rest of this report is organised as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:design} gives an overview of the functional aspects of the FeedApp application, information concerning the use cases, domain model and the architecture of the application.
